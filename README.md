# psicquic-solr

This module uses [SOLR](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) and the SPRING batch framework to index PSI-MI TAB files and return the psicquic search results (binary interactions) in different formats like MITAB, XML, XGMML or RDF/Biopax. It also includes the solr-home directory with the psicquic schema.xml file which has information regarding the indexed and stored fields in PSICQUIC, as defined in the [corresponding specification](http://psicquic.github.io/MiqlDefinition.html). This module is wrapped as a web service in the module [psicquic-solr-ws](https://github.com/PSICQUIC/psicquic-solr-ws).
